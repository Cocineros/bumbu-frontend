# Bumbu Frontend

## Description
"Bumbu" (pronounced boom-boo) is the Indonesian word for "spice", which was the inspiration for this recipe-saving application. Bumbu allows users to create a profile, login and write and save their favorite recipes onto their respective dashboards. To add a recipe, users may click the + button and complete the required input fields. Users may also search for their recipes using the search bar.

## Further Development
For further development of this application, we would like to implement an edit recipe mutation, that allows users to find one recipe and update its contents. We would also like to implement an email library that allows users to export and share their recipes.
